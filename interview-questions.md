# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props in React, is also known as properties which are essentially data that is passed between different components. Since the parent component datas are passed through state, and are not able to be passed outside of it's component, this is where props comes in and enables the code to be dynamic by allowing  data to be passed from parent to child component.

  Researched answer: In React, these are called properties which are data that is passed between different components. Taking data from parent component and passing it down to multiple child components. Properties are only read-only and immutable and cannot be modified.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: a document object model event is any action that is performed by the user that occurs within the interface of a web application. For example, when a user clicks a button, enters any data on an input, hovers over or goes into another page.

  Researched answer: DOM events allows JavaScript to register different types of event handlers on elements that affects the user interface by the end user. Events such as clicking on any element that is displayed on the interface, copy, cut, or pasting any elements, inputting any kind of data, and even just scrolling through the web application are all examples of DOM events. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: object-oriented programming, also known as OOP, is a programming style that mainly utilizes objects that contains attributes and behavior which are called onto methods. While functional programming is solely based on creating functions which avoids the concept of sharing data. 

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which contains data in the form of field known as attributes and code in the form of procedures known as methods. While functional programming treats computation as an evaluation of mathematical functions that avoids the changing state and mutable data.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: an integer is a whole number, while float is a decimal number or numbers including a decimal point. For example, 10, 20, 30 are are whole numbers and 1.2, 10.5, 9.9 are considered float.

  Researched answer: in Ruby, float is a number that contains a decimal point and any number written without decimals are considered an integer. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return in Ruby is automatically set in place and will take action on methods and conditional statements. Speaking from experience, an "if statement" does not need a the "return" keyword after each conditional statement and will automatically return your output.

  Researched answer: An implicit return is when a return isnt explicitly called within a method and ruby will return the value of the last executed instruction in the method or conditional statement. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: a variable that is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks. It is a variable for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.

2. PostgreSQL: a free and open source relational database management system emphansizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

3. Ruby on Rails: a server-side web application framework written in ruby under the MIT license. Rails is a model-view-controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

4. ORM: Object relational mapping is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using OOP languages. 

5. Active Record: active record is an object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.
